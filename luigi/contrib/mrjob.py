""" MRJob wrapper for Luigi

This package provides a convenient Luigi wrapper for using `MRJob
<http://packages.python.org/mrjob/>`_ steps in workflows. See `here
<https://pythonhosted.org/mrjob/guides/runners.html#running-your-job-programmatically>`_
for the feature used to implement this functionality.

The wrapper doesn't attempt to be complete or to hide any complexity. The user
is expected to know their way around MRJob and to configure it separately.

            and fro between filesystems. EMR and Hadoop runners can move input
            data from local file system to S3 or HDFS respectively.

        producing output then the target directory will have been created.
