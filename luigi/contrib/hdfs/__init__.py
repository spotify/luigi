"""
Provides access to HDFS using the :py:class:`HdfsTarget`, a subclass of :py:class:`~luigi.target.Target`.
You can configure what client by setting the "client" config under the "hdfs" section in the configuration, or using the ``--hdfs-client`` command line option.
"hadoopcli" is the slowest, but should work out of the box. "snakebite" is the fastest, but requires Snakebite to be installed.

Currently (4th May) the :py:mod:`luigi.contrib.hdfs` module is under
reorganization. We recommend importing the reexports from
:py:mod:`luigi.contrib.hdfs` instead of the sub-modules, as we're not yet sure
how the final structure of the sub-modules will be. Eventually this module
will be empty and you'll have to import directly from the sub modules like
:py:mod:`luigi.contrib.hdfs.config`.
