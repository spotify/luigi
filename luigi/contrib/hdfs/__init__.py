"""
Provides access to HDFS using the :py:class:`HdfsTarget`, a subclass of :py:class:`~luigi.target.Target`.
You can configure what client by setting the "client" config under the "hdfs" section in the configuration, or using the ``--hdfs-client`` command line option.
"hadoopcli" is the slowest, but should work out of the box. "snakebite" is the fastest, but requires Snakebite to be installed.

Since the hdfs functionality is quite big in luigi, it's split into smaller
files under ``luigi/contrib/hdfs/*.py``. But for the sake of convenience and
API stability, everything is reexported under :py:mod:`luigi.contrib.hdfs`.
