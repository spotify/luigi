We use GitHub issues mainly for tracking bugs and feature requests.
Questions for how to use luigi can be sent to the mailing list.

Currently, there are no strict procedures or guidelines for submitting issues.
In short, please just use common sense.

Common sense includes this at bare-minimum:

 * search for similar issues posted before creating a new issue.
 * Use markdown to format all code/logs. Issues which are hard to read
   when rendered on GitHub might be closed with a friendly reminder of this.
 * If applicable, reading relevant parts of the documentation.

Also, add steps to reproduce the bug, if applicable. Sample code would be nice too :)
