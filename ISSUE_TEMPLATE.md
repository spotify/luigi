Currently, there are no strict procedures or guidelines for submitting issues.
In short, please just use common sense.

Common sense includes this at bare-minimum:

 * search for similar issues posted before creating a new issue.
 * Use markdown to format all code/logs. Issues which are hard to read
   when rendered on GitHub might be closed with a friendly reminder of this.

Also, add steps to reproduce the bug, if applicable. Sample code would be nice too :)
