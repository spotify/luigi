# Finds all tasks and task outputs on the dependency paths from the given downstream task T
# up to the given source/upstream task S (optional). If the upstream task is not given,
# all upstream tasks on all dependancy paths of T will be returned.

# Terms:
# if  the execution of Task T depends on the output of task S on a dependancy graph,
#  T is called a downstream/sink task, S is called an upstream/source task.

# This is useful and practical way to find all upstream tasks of task T.
# For example suppose you have a daily computation that starts with a task named Daily.
# And suppose you have another task named Aggregate. Daily triggers a few tasks
# which eventually trigger Aggregate. Now, suppose you find a bug in Aggregate.
# You fixed the bug and now you want to rerun it, including all it's upstream deps.
#
# To do that you run:
#      bin/deps.py --module daily_module Aggregate --daily-param1 xxx --upstream Daily
#
# This will output all the tasks on the dependency path b/w Daily and Aggregate. In
# effect, this is how you find all upstream tasks for Aggregate. Now you can delete its
# output and run Aggregate again. Daily will eventually trigget Aggregate and all tasks on
# the way.
#
# The same code here might be used as a CLI tool as well as a python module.
# In python, invoke find_deps(task, upstream_name) to get a set of all task instances on the
# paths b/w task T and upstream task S. You can then use the task instances to delete their output or
# perform other computation based on that.
#
# Example:
#
# PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:/path/to/your/luigi/tasks bin/deps.py \
# --module my.tasks  MyDownstreamTask
# --downstream_task_param1 123456
# [--upstream MyUpstreamTask]
