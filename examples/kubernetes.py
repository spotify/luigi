Example Kubernetes Job Task.

Requires:

- Official kubernetes-client python library: ``pip install kubernetes``
    - See: https://github.com/kubernetes-client/python/
- Run Within' an Kubernetes cluster with an ClusterRole granting it access to Kubernetes APIs
- OR A working kubectl configuration and that is active and functional
    - This can be your kubectl config setup for EKS with `aws eks update-kubeconfig --name clustername`
    - Or access to any other hosted/managed/self-setup Kubernetes cluster
    - For devs can a local minikube custer up and running: http://kubernetes.io/docs/getting-started-guides/minikube/
    - Or for devs Docker Desktop has support for minikube: https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop

You can run this code example like this:

    .. code:: console
        $ PYTHONPATH=. luigi --module examples.kubernetes_job PerlPi --local-scheduler
        # Or alternatively...
        $ python -m luigi --module examples.kubernetes PerlPi --local-scheduler

Running this code will create a pi-luigi-uuid kubernetes job within the cluster
of whatever your current context is for kubectl.  The login herein will auto-detect if this
is running in an Kubernetes Cluster and has functional access to the local cluster's APIs
via an ClusterRole, and if not it will then try to use the kubeconfig and its various environment
variables to support configuring and tweaking kubectl.

DEPRECATION NOTE: The previous version of the kubernetes library had you configure your kubectl configuration file
as an property in the config file.  This was removed in favor of using the kubectl standards.  To specify a config use
the env variable KUBECONFIG.  For example:

    .. code:: console
        $ KUBECONFIG=~/.kube/my-custom-config PYTHONPATH=. luigi --module examples.kubernetes_job PerlPi --local-scheduler
