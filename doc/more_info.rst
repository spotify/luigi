Luigi is the successor to a couple of attempts that we weren't fully
happy with. We learned a lot from our mistakes and some design decisions
include:

-  Straightforward command line integration.
-  As little boilerplate as possible.
-  Focus on job scheduling and dependency resolution, not a particular
   platform. In particular this means no limitation to Hadoop. Though
   Hadoop/HDFS support is built-in and is easy to use, this is just one
   of many types of things you can run.
-  A file system abstraction where code doesn't have to care about where
   files are located.
-  Atomic file system operations through this abstraction. If a task
   crashes it won't lead to a broken state.
-  The dependencies are decentralized. No big config file in XML. Each
   task just specifies which inputs it needs and cross-module
   dependencies are trivial.
-  A web server that renders the dependency graph and does locking etc
   for free.
-  Trivial to extend with new file systems, file formats and job types.
   You can easily write jobs that inserts a Tokyo Cabinet into
   Cassandra. Adding broad support S3, MySQL or Hive should be a stroll
   in the park. (Feel free to send us a patch when you're done!)
-  Date algebra included.
-  Lots of unit tests of the most basic stuff

It wouldn't be fair not to mention some limitations with the current
design:

-  Its focus is on batch processing so it's probably less useful for
   near real-time pipelines or continuously running processes.
-  The assumption is that a each task is a sizable chunk of work. While
   you can probably schedule a few thousand jobs, it's not meant to
   scale beyond tens of thousands.
-  Luigi maintains a strict separation between scheduling tasks and
   running them. Dynamic for-loops and branches are non-trivial to
   implement. For instance, it's tricky to iterate a numerical
   computation task until it converges.

It should actually be noted that all these limitations are not
fundamental in any way. However, it would take some major refactoring
work.

Also it should be mentioned that Luigi is named after the world's second
most famous plumber.
