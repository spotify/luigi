Tasks
-----

Tasks are where the execution takes place.
Tasks depend on each other and output targets.

An outline of how a task can look like:

       :alt: Task breakdown

.. _Task.requires:

Task.requires
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The :func:`~luigi.task.Task.requires` method is used to specify dependencies on other Task object,
which might even be of the same class.
For instance, an example implementation could be

.. code:: python

    def requires(self):
        return OtherTask(self.date), DailyReport(self.date - datetime.timedelta(1))

In this case, the DailyReport task depends on two inputs created earlier,
one of which is the same class.
requires can return other Tasks in any way wrapped up within dicts/lists/tuples/etc.

Requiring another Task
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Note that :func:`~luigi.task.Task.requires` can *not* return a :class:`~luigi.target.Target` object.
If you have a simple Target object that is created externally
you can wrap it in a Task class like this:

.. code:: python

    class LogFiles(luigi.ExternalTask):
        def output(self):
            return luigi.contrib.hdfs.HdfsTarget('/log')

This also makes it easier to add parameters:

.. code:: python

    class LogFiles(luigi.ExternalTask):
        date = luigi.DateParameter()
        def output(self):
            return luigi.contrib.hdfs.HdfsTarget(self.date.strftime('/log/%Y-%m-%d'))

.. _Task.output:

Task.output
~~~~~~~~~~~

The :func:`~luigi.task.Task.output` method returns one or more :class:`~luigi.target.Target` objects.
Similarly to requires, you can return them wrapped up in any way that's convenient for you.
However we recommend that any :class:`~luigi.task.Task` only return one single :class:`~luigi.target.Target` in output.
If multiple outputs are returned,
atomicity will be lost unless the :class:`~luigi.task.Task` itself can ensure that each :class:`~luigi.target.Target` is atomically created.
(If atomicity is not of concern, then it is safe to return multiple :class:`~luigi.target.Target` objects.)

.. code:: python

    class DailyReport(luigi.Task):
        date = luigi.DateParameter()
        def output(self):
            return luigi.contrib.hdfs.HdfsTarget(self.date.strftime('/reports/%Y-%m-%d'))
        # ...

.. _Task.run:

Task.run
~~~~~~~~

The :func:`~luigi.task.Task.run` method now contains the actual code that is run.
When you are using Task.requires_ and Task.run_ Luigi breaks down everything into two stages.
First it figures out all dependencies between tasks,
then it runs everything.
The :func:`~luigi.task.Task.input` method is an internal helper method that just replaces all Task objects in requires
with their corresponding output.
An example:

.. code:: python

    class TaskA(luigi.Task):
        def output(self):
            return luigi.LocalTarget('xyz')

    class FlipLinesBackwards(luigi.Task):
        def requires(self):
            return TaskA()

        def output(self):
            return luigi.LocalTarget('abc')

        def run(self):
            f = self.input().open('r') # this will return a file stream that reads from "xyz"
            g = self.output().open('w')
            for line in f:
                g.write('%s\n', ''.join(reversed(line.strip().split())))
            g.close() # needed because files are atomic


.. _Task.input:

Task.input
~~~~~~~~~~

As seen in the example above, :func:`~luigi.task.Task.input` is a wrapper around Task.requires_ that
returns the corresponding Target objects instead of Task objects.
Anything returned by Task.requires_ will be transformed, including lists,
nested dicts, etc.
This can be useful if you have many dependencies:

.. code:: python

    class TaskWithManyInputs(luigi.Task):
        def requires(self):
            return {'a': TaskA(), 'b': [TaskB(i) for i in xrange(100)]}

        def run(self):
            f = self.input()['a'].open('r')
            g = [y.open('r') for y in self.input()['b']]


Dynamic dependencies
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Sometimes you might not know exactly what other tasks to depend on until runtime.
In that case, Luigi provides a mechanism to specify dynamic dependencies.
If you yield another :class:`~luigi.task.Task` in the Task.run_ method,
the current task will be suspended and the other task will be run.
You can also return a list of tasks.

.. code:: python

    class MyTask(luigi.Task):
        def run(self):
            other_target = yield OtherTask()

	    # dynamic dependencies resolve into targets
	    f = other_target.open('r')


This mechanism is an alternative to Task.requires_ in case
you are not able to build up the full dependency graph before running the task.
It does come with some constraints:
the Task.run_ method will resume from scratch each time a new task is yielded.
In other words, you should make sure your Task.run_ method is idempotent.
(This is good practice for all Tasks in Luigi, but especially so for tasks with dynamic dependencies).

For an example of a workflow using dynamic dependencies, see
`examples/dynamic_requirements.py <https://github.com/spotify/luigi/blob/master/examples/dynamic_requirements.py>`_.

.. _Events:

Events and callbacks
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Luigi has a built-in event system that
allows you to register callbacks to events and trigger them from your own tasks.
You can both hook into some pre-defined events and create your own.
Each event handle is tied to a Task class and
will be triggered only from that class or
a subclass of it.
This allows you to effortlessly subscribe to events only from a specific class (e.g. for hadoop jobs).

.. code:: python

    @luigi.Task.event_handler(luigi.Event.SUCCESS)
    def celebrate_success(task):
        """Will be called directly after a successful execution
           of `run` on any Task subclass (i.e. all luigi Tasks)
        """
        ...

    @luigi.contrib.hadoop.JobTask.event_handler(luigi.Event.FAILURE)
    def mourn_failure(task, exception):
        """Will be called directly after a failed execution
           of `run` on any JobTask subclass
        """
        ...

    luigi.run()


But I just want to run a Hadoop job?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Hadoop code is integrated in the rest of the Luigi code because
we really believe almost all Hadoop jobs benefit from being part of some sort of workflow.
However, in theory, nothing stops you from using the :class:`~luigi.contrib.hadoop.JobTask` class (and also :class:`~luigi.contrib.hdfs.target.HdfsTarget`)
without using the rest of Luigi.
You can simply run it manually using

.. code:: python

    MyJobTask('abc', 123).run()

You can use the hdfs.target.HdfsTarget class anywhere by just instantiating it:

.. code:: python

    t = luigi.contrib.hdfs.target.HdfsTarget('/tmp/test.gz', format=format.Gzip)
    f = t.open('w')
    # ...
    f.close() # needed

.. _Task.priority:

Task priority
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The scheduler decides which task to run next from
the set of all tasks that have all their dependencies met.
By default, this choice is pretty arbitrary,
which is fine for most workflows and situations.

If you want to have some control on the order of execution of available tasks,
you can set the ``priority`` property of a task,
for example as follows:

.. code:: python

    # A static priority value as a class constant:
    class MyTask(luigi.Task):
        priority = 100
        # ...

    # A dynamic priority value with a "@property" decorated method:
    class OtherTask(luigi.Task):
        @property
        def priority(self):
            if self.date > some_threshold:
                return 80
            else:
                return 40
        # ...

Tasks with a higher priority value will be picked before tasks with a lower priority value.
There is no predefined range of priorities,
you can choose whatever (int or float) values you want to use.
The default value is 0.

Warning: task execution order in Luigi is influenced by both dependencies and priorities, but
in Luigi dependencies come first.
For example:
if there is a task A with priority 1000 but still with unmet dependencies and
a task B with priority 1 without any pending dependencies,
task B will be picked first.


Instance caching
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In addition to the stuff mentioned above,
Luigi also does some metaclass logic so that
if e.g. ``DailyReport(datetime.date(2012, 5, 10))`` is instantiated twice in the code,
it will in fact result in the same object.
See :ref:`Parameter-instance-caching` for more info
