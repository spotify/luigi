Code of conduct
---------------

This project adheres to the `Open Code of Conduct 
<https://github.com/spotify/code-of-conduct/blob/master/code-of-conduct.md>`_.  By 
participating, you are expected to honor this code.

Running the tests
-----------------

We are always happy to receive Pull Requests. When you open a PR, it will
automatically build on Travis. So you're not strictly required to test the
patch locally before submitting it.

If you do want to run the tests locally you'll need to ``pip install tox`` and
then run one of the tox commands below.

You will need a ``tox --version`` of at least 2.0.

.. code:: bash

    # These commands are pretty fast and will tell if you've
    # broken something major:
    tox -e flake8
    tox -e py27-core

    # You can also test particular files for even faster iterations
    tox -e py27-core test/rpc_test.py

    # The visualiser tests require phantomjs to be installed on your path
    tox -e visualiser

    # And some of the others involve downloading and running Hadoop:
    tox -e py33-cdh
    tox -e py34-hdp

Where ``flake8`` is the lint checking, ``py27`` is obviously Python 2.7.
``core`` are tests that do not require external components and ``cdh`` and
``hdp`` are two different hadoop distributions. For most local development it's
usually enough to run the lint checking and a python version for ``core``
and let Travis run for the whole matrix.

For `cdh` and `hdp`, tox will download the hadoop distribution for you. You
however have to have Java installed and the `JAVA_HOME` environment variable
set.

For more details, check out the ``.travis.yml`` and ``tox.ini`` files.

Writing documentation
=====================

All documentation for Luigi is written in `reStructuredText/Sphinx markup
<http://sphinx-doc.org/domains.html#the-python-domain>`_ and are both in the
code as docstrings and in `.rst`. Pull requests should come with documentation
when appropriate.

You verify that your documentation code compiles by running

.. code:: bash

    tox -e docs

After that, you can check how it renders locally with your browser

.. code:: bash

    firefox doc/_build/html/index.html
